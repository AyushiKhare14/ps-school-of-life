                    <p class="ps-4 pe-4 fs-6 welcome-msg">We all go to schools, study and then enter into the real world. But how much we were taught in schools is actually what is needed outside? Did they teach you how important it is to start savings at an early age? Or did they tell you how to embrace failures? Or be happy for others? Life is not fair to us all the time. It teaches us lessons which no one will tell us about! Would it be great if we or our children can attend a school which nurtures them for real life.</p>

                    <p class="ps-4 pe-4 fs-6 welcome-msg">Nor every law student will become lawyer, neither every engineering graduate will end up being an engineer for life. But we all sure will be parents one day, a partner, a soul mate to someone. Won't it be great if someone can these skills as well. To be honest no school is perfect. Doesn't matter how nice a course is designed, you still need practical real life hands-on. This is where our courses excel.</p>

                    <p class="ps-4 pe-4 fs-6 welcome-msg">There are no boring lectures or theory. And definitely not algebra. Our courses are designed in such a way, you will feel like you are watching your favorite series on an OTT. Not just that, you will be part of that series as well, where will make decisions, you will act and you will bear the consequences of your acts, either good or bad. The best part is your earn your next course. If you do wonderful in your current course the next one is on us! Cause all we wish is to create a better world.</p>
